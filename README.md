📊 MyPolls — A Fully Automated, AI-Powered Election Poll Aggregator & Calibration System
Objective:

MyPolls was born from a simple observation:

In my country, political polling is often used less as an information tool for the public and more as a propaganda instrument for politicians — to manipulate perception, inspire fear, or artificially boost certain candidates.

This project aims to fix that.

MyPolls is an independent, transparent, AI-driven polling aggregation and calibration system designed to model election results without political bias, using strictly measurable accuracy metrics.
It automatically fetches polls, cleans them, merges new data, computes weighted estimates, evaluates institutions based on historical accuracy, and improves itself over time.
